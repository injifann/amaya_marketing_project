# Transforming Challenges into Opportunities: Our Recent Project in Oromia

In Ethiopia's rapidly evolving economy, agriculture remains the backbone — especially in regions like Oromia, home to vast fertile lands and iconic products such as coffee, grains, and horticulture. Yet many small-to-medium agribusinesses face persistent hurdles: limited market visibility, inefficient supply chains, and low digital adoption.

Last year, our team partnered with a forward-thinking farmers' cooperative in the Ana Sora district of Oromia to address these exact issues. The goal? Shift from subsistence-focused production to a more market-oriented model while building sustainable digital channels for direct customer engagement.



## Understanding the Client's Starting Point

The cooperative, representing over 350 smallholder farmers, specialized in high-quality horticultural crops and pulses. Despite strong production capacity, they relied almost entirely on traditional middlemen, resulting in:

- Thin profit margins (often 15-20% lost to intermediaries)
- Limited price negotiation power
- Seasonal cash-flow challenges
- Minimal brand recognition outside local markets

Our initial assessment revealed significant untapped potential — especially with Ethiopia's growing urban middle class and increasing internet penetration driving demand for traceable, quality produce.

## Our Tailored Strategy

We implemented a phased, practical approach combining on-the-ground support with digital tools:

1. **Market-Oriented Production Shift**  
   Drawing from proven models like the SHEP (Smallholder Horticulture Empowerment and Promotion) approach, we conducted farmer training on market needs analysis, quality standards, and crop planning aligned with buyer preferences in Addis Ababa and beyond.

2. **Digital Presence Build-Out**  
   - Launched a simple, mobile-friendly website showcasing products, farmer stories, and transparent pricing.  
   - Set up targeted social media profiles (primarily Telegram channels and Facebook) for direct orders and real-time updates.  
   - Introduced basic digital catalog tools for wholesalers and retailers.

3. **Direct Buyer Connections**  
   Facilitated partnerships with urban supermarkets, hotels, and export-oriented buyers, including logistics coordination to reduce spoilage and delivery times.

4. **Capacity Building**  
   Trained cooperative leaders in basic digital marketing, order management, and financial tracking — empowering them to sustain progress independently.



## Measurable Results and Impact

Within 12 months, the cooperative achieved impressive outcomes:

- **Sales volume increase of 42%** compared to the previous season  
- **Direct urban sales share rose from 8% to 35%**, bypassing many intermediaries  
- **Average farmer income per harvest improved by 28-35%** (depending on crop)  
- **Online inquiries and orders** grew steadily, with Telegram channel reaching 4,200+ subscribers  
- Reduced post-harvest losses through better planning and faster market linkages

These gains not only strengthened the cooperative financially but also built confidence among farmers to invest in quality improvements and new varieties.



## Key Lessons Learned

Success in Ethiopia's context requires blending global best practices with deep local understanding:

- **Start small and mobile-first** — most stakeholders access the internet via smartphones.  
- **Focus on trust and transparency** — sharing farmer photos, harvest stories, and quality certifications builds buyer loyalty.  
- **Combine digital with physical** — digital tools amplify impact only when paired with reliable logistics and training.  
- **Empower local leadership** — sustainable change happens when the cooperative owns the process.

## Looking Ahead

Projects like this demonstrate Ethiopia's agricultural sector is poised for transformation. With supportive policies, growing digital infrastructure, and committed partners, businesses in Oromia and across the country can achieve greater resilience and profitability.

We're proud to have played a small part in this journey and look forward to supporting more clients in unlocking their potential.
